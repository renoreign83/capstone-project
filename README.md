ADHD NO MORE is a powerful and intuitive to-do list application built with React. It aims to provide a seamless and organized experience for individuals with ADHD, helping them manage their tasks effectively. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Getting Started
To get started with ADHD NO MORE, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adhd-no-more.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd adhd-no-more
Install the dependencies for the frontend:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This will run the frontend app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view and interact with the application. The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

Set up the backend with Heroku:
Create a Heroku account if you don't have one.
Follow the Heroku documentation to create a new app.
Connect the app to your repository on Heroku and deploy it.
Make sure to configure the necessary environment variables and settings for your backend.
Now you have both the frontend and backend of ADHD NO MORE set up and ready to use!

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, giving you full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. At this point, you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
